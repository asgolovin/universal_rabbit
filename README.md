# The Universal Rabbit üê∞
A model of diversity in ecology

## Getting Started

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage Python environments and 
dependencies. To install Poetry on Linux, Windows or macOS, go to the [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Then, type the following commands:

 ```
 poetry shell
 poetry install
 ```

 This creates a new python environment for the project and installs all packages. 
 To add a new dependency, type:

```
poetry add <package name>
```

and commit the `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` files.
